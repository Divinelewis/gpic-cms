# Gospel Power International Church (GPIC) Website

This is the official website project for **Gospel Power International Church (GPIC)**.

The vision of this platform is to create a strong digital presence for the church — a place where people can learn more about GPIC, stay updated with upcoming events, access livestream services, and connect with the ministry from anywhere in the world.

This project is being built with **Next.js** and modern web technologies to ensure performance, responsiveness, and scalability.

More features and documentation will be added as development progresses and the project moves toward deployment.
